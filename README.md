> <strong>HIGHLY IN DEVELOPMENT: Do not use for production</strong><br><br>
> This importer harvests episodes and series (lecture recordings) from Opencast instances and pushes them as external references to an Edu-Sharing instance.

## Requirements
* NodeJS 10.12.0 or higher

## Install

1. Clone repository and change into repository folder
2. Install dependencies `npm install`

## Config Minimum

1. Add new user to your Edu-Sharing instance. For more information see [Edu-Sharing documentation](https://docs.edu-sharing.com/confluence/edp/de/administration/managing-user-groups/nutzer-verwalten).
2. Rename `.env.template` file to `.env`
3. Edit `.env` file as described in the comments.<br />Minimum required variables are Edu-Sharing host specs (protocol, domain), user and password.
```sh
# (Required) Edu-Sharing host
ES_HOST_PROTO=http
ES_HOST_DOMAIN=localhost

# (Required) Edu-Sharing User to publish Opencast content with
ES_USER=opencast
ES_PASSWORD=opencast
```
4. Rename `config.oc-instances.js.template` to `config.oc-instances.js` in folder `./src/config/`
5. Edit `./src/config/config.oc-instances.js` and add Opencast instances as JSON objects (orgName, orgUrl, protocol, domain). Keys with org Prefix are nescessary for a minimal metadata set of Edu-Sharing nodes.<br />
```js
{
  orgName: 'Opencast',
  orgUrl: 'https://opencast.org',
  protocol: 'https',
  domain: 'develop.opencast.org'
}
```

## Usage

1. Run `npm start` in repository directory.
```sh
npm start
// or directly
node src/index.js
```

## Config Details

Will be added later.

## Import Workflow

1. Get all published episodes from Opencast Instance
2. Filter episodes by open licences
3. Get all published series from Opencast Instance
4. Edu-Sharing authentication (Basic auth or Bearer token)
5. Create folder structure in Edu-Sharing user workspace (a folder for every Opencast series)
6. Create a node/children for every episode (Alfresco API)
7. Update metadata for all nodes/childrens
8. Update thumbnails/preview images for episodes nodes/children
9. Set permissions for all nodes/childrens to public

## Develop

1. Setup development environment. You can use the [official Edu-Sharing docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/edusharing/repo-rs-moodle/).
2. Follow all minimum config steps as described above.
3. Run nodemon to watch for file changes
```sh
npm run dev
```

## Format & Lint

Linting and formatting is run by a husky-hook with every commit. See `package.json` file for config.

You can also run linting and formatting via this commands:

```sh
npm run format
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix
```
