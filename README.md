> This importer harvests episodes and series (lecture recordings) from Opencast instances and pushes them as external references to an Edu-Sharing instance.

## Install

1. Clone repository and change into repository folder
2. Install dependencies `npm install`

## Config Minimum

1. Add new user to your Edu-Sharing instance 
2. Rename `.env.template` file to `.env`
3. Edit `.env` file as described in the comments.<br />Minimum required variables are Edu-Sharing host specs (protocol, domain), user and password.
```sh
# (Required) Edu-Sharing host
ES_HOST_PROTO=http
ES_HOST_DOMAIN=localhost

# (Required) Edu-Sharing User to publish Opencast content with
ES_USER=opencast
ES_PASSWORD=opencast
```
4. Rename `config.oc-instances.js.template` to `config.oc-instances.js` in folder `./src/config/`
5. Edit `./src/config/config.oc-instances.js` and add Opencast instances as JSON objects (protocal, domain). <br /><strong>LIMITATION: Currently, only the first object in the instance array is used..</strong>
```js
{
  protocol: 'https',
  domain: 'develop.opencast.org'
}
```

## Config Details

Will be added later.
